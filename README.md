## Alternatives

This section provides an overview of similar tools in this space, and how they are different.

### cuda-api-wrappers

url: https://github.com/eyalroz/cuda-api-wrappers

- Aims to provide wrappers for the CUDA runtime API
- Development has slowed a bit recently
- Has 1 or 2 main developers
- Has gained quite a bit of attention (e.g. 440 stars; 57 forks)

The project is planning to support more of the Driver API (for fine-grained control of CUDA devices) and NVRTC API (for runtime compilation of kernels); there is a release candidate ([`v0.5.0-rc1`](https://github.com/eyalroz/cuda-api-wrappers/tree/v0.5.0-rc1)).
